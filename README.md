# Go-Reloaded

**This was my first big project in my school**
You clone this repository, you put a text into a file like sample.txt, the code will then correct it and put it into an ouput file that you also specify through arguments. This code handles ponctuation errors, transforms hex and bin into
their respective numbers. You use arguments on the terminal for this project
Example: go run . sample.txt ouput.txt
